# Home Assistant Add-on: Schedy UI

Manage Schedy schedulers in an easier way with Schedy UI :tada:

## Installation

Add the repository URL under **Supervisor -> Add-on store -> Three dots -> Manage add-on repositories**:

```
https://github.com/alemuro/hassio-schedy-ui
```

## Development

The NextJS project is located under `schedy-ui/src`. To run the server, go to that folder and run `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
